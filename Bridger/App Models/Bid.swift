//  Bid.swift
//  BridgeScoring
//
//  A Bid object keeps track of all the properties of a single Bid. This includes
//  the declarer of the bid, how many tricks they bid, the trump suit they chose, etc.
//  It also keeps track of the result of the bid, including its success relative to the
//  declarer, as well as the number of tricks that were won by the declarer.
//
//  It has the capability of calculating its own score once there is enough information
//  to do so. Score calculation is triggered by calling the method calculateContractScore()
//  which updates the overTheLineScore and underTheLineScore properties.
//
//  Most variables are set by the user during the Bid creation process, and some are set
//  during the Bid editing process (after a round is finished). The only variable that is dependent
//  on the Game state in rubber bridge is vulnerability.
